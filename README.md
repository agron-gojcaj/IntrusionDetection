🚨 Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using PyTorch & Scikit-learn
This project implements an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using the NSL-KDD dataset, a benchmark dataset for evaluating network-based intrusion detection models. The system combines both deep learning (PyTorch) and machine learning (scikit-learn) models for comparative analysis.

📁 Dataset
The project uses the processed kdd_train.csv and kdd_test.csv versions of the NSL-KDD dataset, containing 42 features per instance (both numerical and categorical).

Target variable: normal (label 0) or attack (label 1)

Categorical features are label-encoded

Features are scaled using MinMaxScaler

🔗 Original dataset available from the NSL-KDD Repository

🧠 Models Included
1. SimpleNN (PyTorch)
Feedforward neural network:

Input layer (41 features)

Two hidden layers with ReLU activation and Dropout

Output layer with Sigmoid activation for binary classification

2. Random Forest Classifier (Scikit-learn)
Ensemble-based traditional classifier

Handles both categorical and numerical data

Fast and accurate for tabular data

3. Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Scikit-learn)
Kernel-based classifier

Trained on a subset of the dataset due to computational cost

Effective in high-dimensional spaces

📊 Evaluation Metrics
For each model, the following metrics are computed:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-Score

Bar plots are generated to visually compare model performance across these metrics.
